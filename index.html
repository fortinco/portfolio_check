    “Movies touch our hearts and awaken our vision, 
    and change the way we see things. They take us to 
    other places, they open doors and minds. Movies are 
    the memories of our life time, we need to keep them alive.” 
    - Martin Scorsese

    As a little kid, the best Fridays were always ones where I got to pick out a movie from Blockbuster and watch it with my dad. Now, I can’t make it through a movie without stopping to point out a fun fact, acknowledge a breathtaking camera shot, or try to explain the deeper meaning behind why the walls are a certain color. Without a doubt in my mind, I am a film major in an alternative universe

    Although my career ambitions have since then transitioned into technology focused interests, my love for film has still remained. I decided to combine my passions for web development and design and movies to create a website paying homage to my favorite production company: A24.
