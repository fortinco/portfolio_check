    <h1> 
        Notable A24 Movies
    </h1>

<p> As an avid movie fan and A24 junkie, I have seen a fair amount of A24 movies. The following are the 3 that have captured my heart the most </p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="poster-one">
        <img src="imgs/ladybird.jpg" alt="Lady Bird Movie Poster">
    </div>
    <div class="ladybird">
        <p>In Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig reveals herself to be a bold new cinematic voice with her directorial debut, excavating both the humor and pathos in the turbulent bond between a mother and her teenage daughter. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="disasterartist">
        <p>The Disaster Artist is a hilarious and welcome reminder that there is more than one way to become a legendâ€”and no limit to what you can achieve when you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="poster-two">
        <img src="imgs/disaster.jpg" alt="Disaster Artist Movie Poster">
    </div>
    <div class="poster-three">
        <img src="imgs/lobster.jpg" alt="Lobster Movie Poster">
    </div>
    <div class="lobster">
        <p>David has just been dumped by his wife and lives in a society where single people have 45 days to find true love, or else they are turned into the animal of their choice and released into the woods.
